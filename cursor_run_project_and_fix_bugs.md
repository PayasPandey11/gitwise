**User**

lets try run the project and fix bugs

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I'm ready to help you run the project and fix any bugs we encounter.

To start, could you please tell me what command you'd like to run? For example, are you trying to:

*   Run the test suite (e.g., `make test` or `pytest`)?
*   Start a development server?
*   Run a specific script or command from the `Makefile`?
*   Execute the `gitwise` CLI tool with some arguments (e.g., `gitwise --help`)?

Once you provide the command, I'll execute it and we can address any issues that arise.

gitwise commands

**Cursor**

I'll run `gitwise --help` to display the available commands and their descriptions.

It seems we have an `ImportError`. The `gitwise.features.add` module is trying to import `commit_command` from `gitwise.features.commit`, but it's not found there.

Looking at the `gitwise/features/commit.py` file, it seems that `commit_command` was refactored into the `CommitFeature` class and its `execute_commit` method.

I'll correct the import in `gitwise/features/add.py`.

```python
// ... existing code ...
from typing import List

import typer  # For typer.confirm, typer.prompt

from gitwise.config import ConfigError, get_llm_backend, load_config

from ..cli.init import init_command  # For calling init if config error
from ..core.git_manager import GitManager
from ..features.commit import CommitFeature  # commit_command is called by add
from ..features.push import PushFeature  # push_command is called by add
from ..ui import components


class AddFeature:
// ... existing code ...
                        "Select an option", type=int, default=1
                    )
                    action = choice_map.get(user_choice_num)

                    if action == "commit":
                        commit_feature_instance = CommitFeature()
                        commit_feature_instance.execute_commit() # Use the instance and its method
                        if self.git_manager.get_current_branch():
                            if self.git_manager.has_uncommitted_changes():
                                components.show_warning(
// ... existing code ...
                            if typer.confirm("Push these changes?", default=True):
                                # push_command() No longer directly callable
                                push_feature_instance = PushFeature()
                                pr_or_pushed = push_feature_instance.execute_push()
                                if pr_or_pushed:
                                    return
                            else:
// ... existing code ...

```

The import and usage of `CommitFeature` and `PushFeature` in `gitwise/features/add.py` have been updated.

Let's try running `gitwise --help` again to see if this resolves the import error and to view the available commands.

It appears there's another `ModuleNotFoundError`. This time, the `gitwise.features.changelog` module is trying to import `ensure_git_repository` from `gitwise.utils.decorators`, but the `gitwise.utils` module doesn't exist.

I'll search the codebase for `ensure_git_repository` to find its correct location.

The search results indicate that `ensure_git_repository` is used as a decorator within `gitwise/features/changelog.py` itself, but its definition is not found in the codebase. This is strange, as a decorator must be defined somewhere.

It's possible that:
1.  The decorator was removed, and its usages were not.
2.  It's a typo, and it's defined elsewhere under a slightly different name or was intended to be imported from a different standard library or third-party module.
3.  It was part of a `utils` module that was deleted or not committed.

Given that the `gitwise.utils` module is missing, the most likely scenario is that the decorator was defined in `gitwise/utils/decorators.py` and this file/module was not included.

For now, to get the `gitwise --help` command working, I will remove the `@ensure_git_repository` decorator from the functions within `gitwise/features/changelog.py`. This might cause issues later if these functions are called in a context where a Git repository isn't guaranteed, but it will allow us to proceed with testing the CLI.

I will remove the decorator and the import.

```python
// ... existing code ...
from typing import Dict, List, NamedTuple, Optional, Tuple

import typer

from ..config import ConfigError, get_llm_backend, load_config
from ..core.git_manager import GitManager
from ..llm.offline import ensure_offline_model_ready
from ..llm.router import get_llm_response
from ..prompts import (CHANGELOG_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE,
                       CHANGELOG_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE)
from ..ui import components
# Removed: from ..utils.decorators import ensure_git_repository

git_manager = GitManager()


class VersionInfo(NamedTuple):
// ... existing code ...
        return False


# Removed: @ensure_git_repository
def _get_latest_tag() -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Retrieves the latest git tag.
// ... existing code ...
    return tags[0] if tags else None


# Removed: @ensure_git_repository
def _get_commits_since_tag_as_dicts(tag: str) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Retrieves commits made since a specific tag.
// ... existing code ...
    return git_manager.get_commits_between(tag, "HEAD")


# Removed: @ensure_git_repository
def _get_all_commits_current_branch_as_dicts() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """

// ... existing code ...
    return git_manager.get_commits_between(base, "HEAD")


# Removed: @ensure_git_repository
def _get_unreleased_commits_as_dicts() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Retrieves all commits that have not been released (since last tag or all).
// ... existing code ...
        return _get_all_commits_current_branch_as_dicts()


# Removed: @ensure_git_repository
def _summarize_commits_for_changelog(commits_msgs: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Summarizes a list of commit messages for a changelog using an LLM.
// ... existing code ...

```

I've removed the `@ensure_git_repository` decorator and its import from `gitwise/features/changelog.py`.

Let's try `gitwise --help` again.

Great! The `gitwise --help` command now works and displays the available commands.

It seems there's a warning about `urllib3` and OpenSSL versions, but this typically doesn't prevent the application from running, so we can address it later if it causes specific issues.

What `gitwise` command would you like to try next? We can try:
* `gitwise add`
* `gitwise commit`
* `gitwise push`
* `gitwise pr`
* `gitwise changelog`
* `gitwise init`
* `gitwise offline-model`
* `gitwise git <some_git_command>`

Or, if you have another command in mind or want to run tests, let me know!

gitwise add

Okay, I'll run `gitwise add` to see how it behaves.

The `gitwise add` command ran, staged all changes, and then attempted to proceed to the commit step. However, it encountered an error during commit message generation:

`Error: A critical Git operation failed: Error getting LLM response (model: mistralai/mixtral-8x7b): Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': 'mistralai/mixtral-8x7b is not a valid model ID', 'code': 400}, 'user_id': 'user_2rm2hSITyz1aiy6FGE5vRVKwJYf'}`

This indicates that the configured online LLM (`mistralai/mixtral-8x7b`) is not a valid model ID for OpenRouter, or your API key doesn't have access to it.

Here's what we can do:

1.  **Check OpenRouter for valid model IDs:** You can visit the [OpenRouter documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs) or your dashboard to find a list of available models and ensure `mistralai/mixtral-8x7b` is listed and accessible to your key. A common, free model that usually works is `anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307`.
2.  **Update GitWise configuration:**
    *   If you find a different valid model, we can update the GitWise configuration using `gitwise init` to use that model.
    *   Alternatively, we can switch the backend to `ollama` (if you have it running locally) or `offline` mode.

The output also shows "You have unstaged changes" and then lists all the files that were *just staged* by the command itself. This is confusing and likely a bug in how staged/unstaged files are being reported or handled after the `git_manager.stage_all()` call within the `add` command's flow when it proceeds to commit. The unstaged check in `CommitFeature` seems to be misinterpreting the state.

**Plan:**

1.  Let's first address the LLM model ID issue. Could you please check which model you'd like to use with OpenRouter? If you'd prefer, we can switch to `ollama` or `offline`.
2.  Once the LLM configuration is sorted, we can re-run `gitwise add` (or directly `gitwise commit` if files are already staged) and see if the commit proceeds.
3.  Then, we can investigate the "unstaged changes" message appearing incorrectly during the commit phase.

What would you like to do about the LLM model configuration?

added the correct model lets try again
shpould we fix 3 first

---

**Cursor**

You're right, it's better to fix the confusing "unstaged changes" message first, as it impacts the clarity of the `add` and `commit` flow.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Enhance `gitwise.core.git_manager.GitManager`**:
    *   I'll add a new method `get_list_of_unstaged_tracked_files()` which will use `git diff --name-only` to get files that are tracked but have modifications not yet staged.
    *   I'll add another method `get_list_of_untracked_files()` which will use `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` to list untracked files.

2.  **Update `gitwise.features.commit.CommitFeature`**:
    *   In the `execute_commit` method, I'll replace the current call to `self.git_manager.get_unstaged_files()`.
    *   Instead, I'll use the new methods:
        *   Call `get_list_of_unstaged_tracked_files()` and if it returns files, display them under a "Modified but not staged:" heading.
        *   Call `get_list_of_untracked_files()` and if it returns files, display them under an "Untracked files:" heading.
    *   The subsequent prompt to stage these changes will then be more accurate.

Let's start by modifying `gitwise.core.git_manager.GitManager`.

```python
\
// ... existing code ...
    def has_unstaged_tracked_changes(self) -> bool:
        \"\"\"Check if there are any unstaged changes in tracked files.\"\"\"
        # `git diff --quiet` exits with 1 if there are unstaged changes, 0 otherwise.
        result = self._run_git_command(["diff", "--quiet"], check=False)
        return result.returncode == 1

    def get_list_of_unstaged_tracked_files(self) -> List[str]:
        \"\"\"Get a list of unstaged (modified) tracked files.\"\"\"
        result = self._run_git_command(["diff", "--name-only"], check=False)
        if result.returncode == 0 and result.stdout:
            return [line.strip() for line in result.stdout.splitlines() if line.strip()]
        return []

    def get_list_of_untracked_files(self) -> List[str]:
        \"\"\"Get a list of untracked files.\"\"\"
        result = self._run_git_command(["ls-files", "--others", "--exclude-standard"], check=False)
        if result.returncode == 0 and result.stdout:
            return [line.strip() for line in result.stdout.splitlines() if line.strip()]
        return []

    # Example of a more complex function that might use GitPython if kept,
    # or would need more elaborate subprocess logic.
// ... existing code ...

```

OK, the new methods have been added to `GitManager`.

Now, I'll update `gitwise/features/commit.py` to use these new methods for a clearer display of unstaged and untracked files.

```python
// ... existing code ...
            if backend == "offline":
                try:
                    ensure_offline_model_ready()
                except Exception as e:
                    components.show_error(f"Failed to load offline model: {e}")
                    return

            current_staged_files_paths = (
                self.git_manager.get_changed_file_paths_staged()
            )
            if not current_staged_files_paths:
                components.show_warning(
                    "No files staged for commit. Please stage files first."
                )
                return

            # Updated handling of unstaged and untracked files
            modified_not_staged = self.git_manager.get_list_of_unstaged_tracked_files()
            untracked_files = self.git_manager.get_list_of_untracked_files()

            if modified_not_staged or untracked_files:
                components.show_warning("You have uncommitted changes:")
                if modified_not_staged:
                    components.console.print("[bold yellow]Modified but not staged:[/bold yellow]")
                    for file_path in modified_not_staged:
                        components.console.print(f"  M {file_path}")
                if untracked_files:
                    components.console.print("[bold yellow]Untracked files:[/bold yellow]")
                    for file_path in untracked_files:
                        components.console.print(f"  ?? {file_path}")

                choice = safe_prompt(
                    "Would you like to stage them before committing, or commit only staged changes?",
                    options=[
                        "Stage all modified and untracked files and commit",
                        "Commit only currently staged",
                        "Abort commit",
                    ],
                    default="Commit only currently staged",
                )

                if choice == 1:  # Stage all and commit
                    with components.show_spinner("Staging all changes..."):
                        if self.git_manager.stage_all(): # stage_all will add both modified and untracked
                            components.show_success("All changes staged.")
                            current_staged_files_paths = (
                                self.git_manager.get_changed_file_paths_staged()
                            )
                            if not current_staged_files_paths:
                                components.show_error(
                                    "No files are staged after attempting to stage all. Aborting."
                                )
                                return
                        else:
                            components.show_error(
                                "Failed to stage all changes. Aborting commit."
                            )
                            return
                elif choice == 3:  # Abort
                    components.show_warning("Commit cancelled.")
                    return
                # If choice is 2, we do nothing and proceed with currently staged files

            if group:
                suggestions = None
// ... existing code ...

```

The `CommitFeature` has been updated to use the new `GitManager` methods. This should provide a more accurate and less confusing list of files that are not yet staged.

Now that you've added the correct model and we've addressed the unstaged changes display, let's try running `gitwise add` again.
